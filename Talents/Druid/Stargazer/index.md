# Stargazer
Instead of focusing their attention on the land and animals around them, Stargazers study the heavenly bodies that move through the skies. These druids look to connect how the movement of the stars and the moon affect events on the lands below, so they are often sought out as oracles.

Stargazers also like keep records of their findings. However, their archives are typically more esoteric in nature - rock formations, runes and carvings that have been secreted way in caverns, underground libraries, or other locations to ensure their knowledge is kept safe.

## Talents

### Summon the Stars
*Prerequisite:* 1st Level Spells<br>
You call down the stars to grant you their power. As a bonus action, you expend 1 mana and choose which constellation you summon from the list below. A small representation for the stary formation floats near you in your space, but is neither a creature or an object. While it exists, the stars produce bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. 

The constellation lasts for 10 minutes, or if you dismiss it early (no action required), become incapacitated or die or use this talent again. Once you use this talent, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again. 

**The Magician.** Summoning the Magician grants you some of their raw power. As part of the bonus action when you first summon this constellation and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, launching a shard of a star, against one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier.

**The Empress.** The Empress brings you nurturing abundance when called. Whenever you cast a spell using mana that restores stamina to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain stamina equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier.

**The High Priestess.** The High Priestess desires to share her sacred knowledge and strength of mind. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.

### Wheel of Fortune
*Prerequisite:* 3rd Level Spells and Spirits of the Wild<br>
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens. When you do so, roll a die. Until you finish your next long rest, you gain access to a special reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:

Weal (even). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the total.

Woe (odd). Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

 ### Twinkling Constellations 
*Prerequisite:* 5th Level Spells and Empowered Allies<br>
The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a flying speed of 20 feet and can hover.

Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.


 ### Full of Stars
*Prerequisite:* 7th Level Spells and Guardian Spirit<br>While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage
